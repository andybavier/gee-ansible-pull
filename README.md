Checkins to this repository will be pulled by the PlanetIgnite nodes
every 5 minutes.

To prep an Ubuntu 14.04 LTS VM for PlanetIgnite:

```
wget -qO- https://goo.gl/S8Q6tr > prep.sh; sudo bash ./prep.sh
```

The node will be set up in the next 5 minutes.  After it has completed
setup, it's ready to be added to the PlanetIgnite portal.
